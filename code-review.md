Code review is a collaborative process where team members systematically inspect each other's code to ensure its quality, correctness, and maintainability. During a code review, it's important to focus on several key aspects:

1. **How to do**: Start by examining the code changes thoroughly, checking for adherence to coding standards, best practices, and design patterns. Look for potential bugs, logic errors, and areas for optimization. Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
2. **What to focus on**: Pay attention to code readability, clarity, and maintainability. Evaluate the logic flow, error handling, and use of comments/documentation. Consider performance implications and potential security vulnerabilities. Ensure the code aligns with project requirements and follows the established architecture.
3.**How to ask for changes**: When requesting changes, frame feedback in a positive and respectful manner. Clearly explain the reasons behind suggested modifications and offer guidance on how to address them. Encourage open communication and collaboration, emphasizing the shared goal of delivering high-quality software.
4. **Cheering team mates up**: Recognize and appreciate the efforts of team members during code reviews. Acknowledge their contributions and the value they bring to the team. Offer praise for well-written code, insightful comments, and proactive problem-solving. Celebrate successes and milestones together, fostering a supportive and motivating atmosphere within the team.

Overall, code review serves as a crucial mechanism for ensuring code quality, fostering learning and growth, and promoting teamwork and camaraderie within software development teams.
